As someone who cares deeply about the environment and envisions a cleaner, more sustainable future, electric vehicles represent a hopeful shift. They’re not just machines — they’re milestones on our journey toward greener cities and cleaner skies.\nWhen I found this dataset, I was immediately intrigued. It’s rare to get such a comprehensive look at a state’s transition toward electric mobility. And with Washington leading the charge, and Tesla front and center, I saw a story waiting to be told.\nThat said, I don’t want to stop at one state. In the future, I’d love to explore how EV adoption compares across different regions and countries — how infrastructure, policy, and culture shape the road to electrification around the world."

Movies with famous leads tend to influence ratings more than those without. However, in this small dataset, the percentage of high-rated and not-high-rated movies is almost equal. Therefore, it is unclear whether movies with famous actors or actresses are highly rated.\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Group movies according to Ending, High_Rating\nThe genre grouping uses features such as Ending_Happy, Ending_Sad, Ending_Open, and High_Rating, with k = 6. It is evident that movies with happy endings tend to have lower ratings. However, sad and open endings show no significant difference in their high-rating percentages.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Group movies according to High_Voting, High_Rating*\nThe genre grouping uses features such as High_Voting, High_Rating, with k = 4. There is consistent evidence that movies with high voting tend to have high ratings and vice versa. However, low voting seems to impact ratings more than high voting."

# Project Overview  
This project analyzes **book genres and their ratings** using **Pandas, Plotly, and GreatTables**. It presents **structured tables and different bar charts** to explore how **ratings vary across genres and between male and female readers**.  

## Key Features  
- Formatted Data Tables for book genres and their ratings.  
- Stacked/Paired/Facet Charts to compare ratings between male and female readers.  
- Custom Styling for clear and professional presentation.  
- Data Processing with Pandas to analyze genre-based ratings.  

# Visualizations  

## Formatted Data Table and Horizontal Bar Chart: Genre Ratings

### Formatted Data Table  
A well-structured table displaying the **average ratings** for each book genre. The table is color-coded to highlight the highest and lowest rated genres.  
- This table provides numerical data for average reviews and ratings across different genres.  
- Sci-Fi has the highest average rating (2,023,518), followed by Thrillers (1,798,566) and Fantasy (1,561,214).  
- Action and Autobiographies have the lowest ratings in the dataset.

# Technologies Used  
- Python (for data cleaning and analysis)  
- Pandas (for processing book genre ratings)  
- Plotly (for creating bar charts)  
- GreatTables (for generating structured data tables)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and displaying results)  

# Future Improvements

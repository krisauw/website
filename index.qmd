I’m a **Data Science master’s student (Drew University, expected 2026)** with a background in **Economics (B.A.) and minors in Mathematics & Asian Studies**.  
Before transitioning into data, I spent **6+ years managing projects in VFX/animation** and client services—leading cross-functional teams, delivering for global clients, and honing communication and leadership skills.  

Today, I combine that creative and organizational background with **data science, machine learning, and analytics** to solve real-world problems. My work spans **ML model development, coding experiments, and interactive dashboards**.
